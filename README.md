# AirBnB clone
An emulation of the web application [AirBnB](https://www.airbnb.com).
The project had six steps, with each step linking to concept.

We were required to do the following:

## The console
- create your data model
- manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console / command interpreter
- store and persist objects to a file (JSON file)
The first piece is to manipulate a powerful storage system. This storage engine
will give us an abstraction between “My object” and “How they are stored and persisted”.

## Web static
- learn HTML/CSS
- create the HTML of your application
- create template of each object

## MySQL storage
- replace the file storage by a Database storage
- map your models to a table in database by using an O.R.M.

## Web framework - templating
- create your first web server in Python
- make your static HTML file dynamic by using objects stored in a file or database

## RESTful API
- expose all your objects stored via a JSON web interface
- manipulate your objects via a RESTful API

## Web dynamic
- learn JQuery
- load objects from the client side by using your own RESTful API
