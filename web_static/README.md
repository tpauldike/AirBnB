# 0x01. AirBnB clone - Web static
Learning front-end web development by attempting to solve a real life problem.

In this project, I learned how to create some static web content by using `HTML` and `CSS` to partially emulate the [**AirBnB website**](https://www.airbnb.com). Below was the final product I arrived at.
