# 0x01. AirBnB clone - Web static
Learning front-end web development by attempting to solve a real life problem.

In this project, I learned how to create some static web content by using `HTML` and `CSS` to partially emulate the [**AirBnB website**](https://www.airbnb.com). Contained in the current directory are the html files writing step-by-step as required in the project, the sub-directory [**images**](./images) has the logo and the icons used on the web page, and the sub-directory [**styles**](./styles) contains all the external stylesheets written for this project.

Below was the final product I arrived at
